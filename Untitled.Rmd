```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r}
#Sum of 2 + 2
2+2

#Average Sepal Length
mean(iris$Sepal.Length)
```

```{r}
#Levels of Species 
unique(iris$Species)
```
#Inline Code 
Two plus two equals `r 2+2` .
The average Sepal Length is `r mean(iris$Sepal.Length)` .
The three levels of Species are `r unique(iris$Species)`
